Rules and Graphics for a multi-player card game. Please play, fork and pull-request.

Sounds:

Starts:
* Hyuu~
* Kyaa~
* Woo~

Attacks:
* Cho
* Ka
* Ro
* Na
* Hyah

Blocks:
* Waa!
* Shoo!
* So!

Interrupts:
* Ah?
* Wu?
* Ee?

Path to enlightenment (one of each in deck):
* Honor (play with an interrupt)
* Justice (play with an attack)
* Strength (play with a block)
* Fortitude (play with a start)
* Humility (play when interrupted)
* Wisdom (play when blocked)
* Advantage (play when you are target and the attacker is interrupted)

Rules:
------
Each card has both a Resolve and an Opportunity score. A sucessful attack
gives the sum of Resolve cards to the attacker and the sum of Opportunity
to the target. If an attack is blocked successfully, the blocker becomes
the new attacker and takes the current Resolve score. The blocked attacker
becomes the target and takes the current Opportunity score.

Each Start card has a Start Score. At the beginning of the game, each
player may discard as many start cards as they like. Players can keep
discarding start cards until everyone either runs out or chooses to stop.
The player with the highest sum of Start Scores attacks first; then play
continues to the left.

Path to enlightenment cards must be played with their companion card type
(and only when the companion is legal to play). Player gains 10 Ki points,
and their next 1 attack card can't be blocked.

Taking turns:
-------------
During each round, each player takes a turn in order unless otherwise
interrupted. At the end of a turn, play continues to the left from whichever
player ends the round as attacker.

If the player has a start card, they may attack. Otherwise they discard one
card (their choice) and draw two cards and the turn ends. To attack, the
attacking picks an opponent to fight. They then place and call a valid
sequence of cards. Sequences start with any start card, then any attack card,
then any number of compatible attack cards. Cards are called one at a time,
to allow for blocks and interruptions.

When the attacker calls an attack card, the target may play a compatible block
card. The blocked attack is discarded. If the attacker can play an attack
compatible with the block card, that attack must be played, and the attacker
continues as normal. If not, and the target can play an attack compatible with
the block card, all damage is cancelled and the target becomes the new attacker.

If neither, both attacker and target glare menacingly, and the turn is over.
No player other than the current target may play a block card.

At anytime during combat, a player other than the current attacker or target may
play an interrupt. This immediately ends the turn, and play continues to the
left of the interrupter. The player who interrupted draws a card; The attacker
who was interrupted gives a card to the target at random.
Use interrupts to stop bullying.

Once the attacker stops playing attack cards (and is not blocked or interrupted),
the attack resolves. The target loses Ki points for each uncancelled damage point
of the played attack cards. The attacker draws cards equal to the Resolve score.
The target draws cards equal to the Opportunity score.

Calling cards:
--------------
You must take your ninja training seriously. Making an attack without calling
will cause the attack to fail and the turn to end.

To call a card, simply say it's name in a suitably 'Ninja' or 'Kung Fu' way as
it is played. Pirate style may also be acceptable, depending on the other
player's consensus.

End of turn:
------------
At the end of each turn (no matter how it ended) all players must discard
down to a maximum hand size of 12 cards.
